1) Create a model
We start thinking about usage scenarios by putting stubs in for all the methods in the class. These stubs include the proper signature (name, parameter list) and full specifications.

Specification consists of:
// REQUIRES: a REQUIRES specification of a method indicates the preconditions of running that method. 
// MODIFIES: The MODIFIES clause indicates whether a method, or any method it calls, mutates any object.
// EFFECTS: The EFFECTS clause indicates the purpose of the method -- describing the work that the method does and returns.
